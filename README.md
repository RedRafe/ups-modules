# Features

This mod add 2 special features: **FOREST** and **TURBO** that can be used to extremely increase the speed of K2's Greenhouses and Atmospheric Condensers specifically. 

All the technologies, recipes and modules are available about late game, after _Space Tech Cards_ and _Advanced Tech Cards_, in order to preserve the mod's original experience and add some cool puzzle to solve late-game while improving your UPS. 

- **Forests** : can only be used inside greenhouses to boost the production of wood. Forests need a great deal of trees and water, but will benefit your UPS, drastically reducing the number of Greenhouses needed late-game to produce wood.

- **Turbos** : can only be placed in Atmospheric Condensers to boost air-compressing. Turbos require engine units and a big volume of compressed water in order to operate, but will make Atmospheric Condensers extremely fast at what they do.


Additionally, new "bulk" recipes similar to K2's own recipes are created, with special icons, in order to avoid Greenhouses & Atm. Comndensers to eventually hit the _1 craft/second_ limit, similar to stacked recipes.
